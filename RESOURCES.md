TensorFlow Hub is a library for the publication, discovery, and consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models. A module is a self-contained piece of a TensorFlow graph, along with its weights and assets, that can be reused across different tasks in a process known as transfer learning. Transfer learning enables you to:

- Train a model with a smaller dataset
- Improve generalization
- Speed up training

# TensorFlow Models
Link to repository: https://github.com/tensorflow/models

This repository contains a number of different models implemented in TensorFlow

The official models are a collection of example models that use TensorFlow's high-level APIs. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable TensorFlow API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read. We especially recommend newer TensorFlow users to start here.

The research models are a large collection of models implemented in TensorFlow by researchers. They are not officially supported or available in release branches; it is up to the individual researchers to maintain the models and/or provide support on issues and pull requests.

The samples folder contains code snippets and smaller models that demonstrate features of TensorFlow, including code presented in various blog posts.

The tutorials folder is a collection of models described in the TensorFlow tutorials.
