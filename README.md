Off the top of my head, things I want to know:
### Model Building:
- What layers are available
- What each layer does
- The options for each layer, and what they do
- The required input shape
- The output shape

### Model Training:
- The different types of models (Model vs Sequential?)
- Loss functions
- Optimizers
- Metrics
- What I can do with callbacks

### Preprocessing:
- What's available for text preprocessing
- What's available for image preprocessing
